# Reviewer Queue State
# =====================
# This file is automatically maintained by the reviewer-bot workflow.
# It tracks the round-robin assignment of reviewers for coding guidelines.
#
# You can view this file to see:
# - Who is next up to review
# - Who is currently on a pass-until (vacation/away)
# - Recent assignment history
#
# DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY - changes will be overwritten by the bot.
# Use bot commands instead (see CONTRIBUTING.md for details).

# Last updated timestamp (ISO 8601)
last_updated: null

# Current position in round-robin queue (0-indexed)
# The reviewer at this index will be assigned next
current_index: 0

# Queue of active producers in rotation order
# This list is automatically synced from members.md
