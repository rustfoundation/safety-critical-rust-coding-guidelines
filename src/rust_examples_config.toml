# Used to flag examples that may behave differently on the playground

[playground]
# Base URL for the Rust Playground API

[warnings]
# Show version mismatch warning if example version is this many minor versions
# behind the configured default version. Set to 0 to always show, or a high
# number to effectively disable.

# Fail on compiler warnings by default. When true, examples that compile with
# warnings will show a warning status in the interactive output. Set to false
# to allow warnings by default. Individual examples can override this with
# :warn: (fail on warnings) or :warn: allow (permit warnings).

[miri]
